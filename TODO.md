🚀 Next Level Possibilities
1. Publish the Library 📦
Set up automated publishing of @git-actions/docker-utils to npm
Make it available for other projects to use
Add proper versioning and release management
2. Extend the Library ⚡
Add more Docker utilities (build parsing, manifest inspection, etc.)
Add GitHub Actions specific helpers
Create higher-level abstractions for common workflows
3. Optimize & Polish ✨
Bundle optimization: The actions bundle the entire lib (2.4MB) - could tree-shake unused code
Performance: Add caching, connection pooling, or other optimizations
Error handling: Better error types and recovery strategies
4. CI/CD Excellence 🔄
Set up automated testing across all actions
Add integration tests for the full action workflows
Implement proper release pipelines with Nx
5. Developer Experience 🛠️
Add comprehensive documentation and examples
Create a CLI tool for local development/testing
Add more TypeScript strictness and validation
6. Advanced Features 🎯
Add support for different Docker registries (not just Docker Hub)
Implement rate limiting and retry strategies
Add metrics/monitoring hooks
